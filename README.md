# Election_Analysis: intro to Python
## Overview of Election Audit: 
### Purpose of Election Audit
The purpose of this project is to assist Tom with auditing the election data using Python. We will be creating a script to determine the number of votes per county, per candidate, voting turn out numbers, and the winner of the election. 

### Election-Audit Results:
•	How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
o	369,711
•	Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
o	Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
o	Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
o	Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
•	Which county had the largest number of votes?
o	Denver 
•	Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
o	Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
o	Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
o	Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
•	Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
o	Winner: Diana DeGette
o	Winning Vote Count: 272,892
o	Winning Percentage: 73.8%

### Election-Audit Summary:
Through the script created, you can take large or small data files and manipulate them into a short but very telling story. It dissects the files by using things such as dictionaries and lists within the script to do the manual work for us by breaking down the data to get votes count then puts is the tallied results into a separate txt file to make it effortless to read. This script can also be modified to be used to determine whether people are for or against a new bill or law that is being voted on. This can be done by using logical operators specially “or” because it would be a yes or no answer.  You could also modify the script to include a code (SEO) that looks for key words. This could be good if you wanted to add a written survey on electronic ballots for example.
